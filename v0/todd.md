## Professional Profile

Senior software engineer specializing in the design and implementation of large-scale, backward-compatible APIs, high-throughput data services, and operationally rigorous full-stack systems. Deep experience building Node.js/TypeScript microservices handling billions of monthly transactions, complemented by strong frontend competence in React and TypeScript. Adept at extracting performance from existing systems—whether through architectural simplification, data-model redesign, or selective use of Rust for critical execution paths. Strong technical writer capable of producing developer-facing guides, SDK surfaces, and API specifications that reduce friction and accelerate adoption. Known for cross-functional clarity, fast learning, and reliable end-to-end ownership of mission-critical systems.

## Core Competencies

- High-scale REST API architecture; schema evolution, backward compatibility, versioning discipline  
- Node.js/TypeScript microservices; async orchestration, queue-backed workflows, data integrity guarantees  
- React frontends for operational tooling, analytics dashboards, and customer-facing configuration surfaces  
- MongoDB data modelling under high concurrency; index design, write-path optimization  
- Performance engineering; profiling Node.js, offloading hot paths to Rust, reducing latency and CPU cost  
- AWS ecosystems: Lambda, S3, SQS, Batch, CloudWatch, IAM, multi-region patterns  
- Internal tooling for sales/logistics enablement; workflow automation, data quality pipelines  
- Developer enablement: clear API reference writing, sample libraries, onboarding guides  
- Automated testing: Jest, Vitest, integration test harnesses, contract-testing frameworks  
- Cross-functional collaboration with PM, Sales Ops, Logistics, Customer Success, and founders

## Professional Experience

### Senior Full-Stack Engineer — Global Offline Communications Platform  
**Courieryx Systems (Toronto, ON)**  
2020–Present

**API Architecture & Distributed Services**  
Designed and maintained globally distributed REST APIs processing multi-billion monthly workloads across address normalization, print-dispatch automation, job lifecycle management, and customer billing.

- Introduced schema-driven versioning and compatibility guarantees, reducing partner-integration churn and eliminating breaking changes across three product cycles.  
- Designed high-availability Node.js services backed by MongoDB, incorporating idempotent write semantics, transactional safety patterns, and durable queue workflows (SQS).  
- Implemented high-throughput job-processing pipelines using AWS Lambda and Batch to orchestrate multi-stage print, verification, and routing flows.

**Performance Engineering & Rust Acceleration**  
- Profiled and rewrote hot-path content-rendering and PDF pre-processing in Rust, reducing p95 request latency by 48% and compute cost by 32%.  
- Improved MongoDB query paths with targeted indexing strategies and denormalization for bulk-dispatch endpoints.

**Full-Stack Frontend Development**  
- Built React dashboards giving operations teams visibility into print jobs, error states, address-cleanliness metrics, and SLA timelines.  
- Designed customer-facing configuration interfaces enabling non-technical users to orchestrate automated mail flows.

**Internal Tooling & Developer Experience**  
- Authored internal CLI utilities for logistics and sales teams: partner onboarding verification, address-accuracy audits, bulk-ingest workflows.  
- Wrote comprehensive developer documentation, including reference sections, integration playbooks, onboarding recipes, and Postman/OpenAPI examples.  
- Reduced partner onboarding time by over 50% through improvements to documentation quality and sample code.

**Strategic Collaboration**  
- Partnered directly with founders to evaluate product-expansion vectors, including batch-mailing primitives, hybrid digital/offline notification flows, and API monetization strategies.  
- Interfaced with high-value enterprise customers to refine requirements and translate operational needs into system designs.

### Senior Software Engineer — Logistics & Operations Tooling  
**ParcelSpan (Remote)**  
2017–2020

- Built Node.js/TypeScript microservices coordinating parcel-routing, SLA prediction, and print-and-ship batch workflows.  
- Introduced automated test harness using Jest and contract tests, cutting regression defects by 40%.  
- Developed React-based ops consoles providing real-time visibility into global shipments, delays, scans, and processing queues.

---

### Software Engineer — Developer Platforms  
**Northrail Interactive (Toronto, ON)**  
2014–2017

- Developed REST APIs enabling external developers to embed shipping, address-validation, and mail-dispatch capabilities within their own systems.  
- Authored SDK documentation and guides that later became the basis for the partner integration toolkit.  
- Built internal tools for auditing address data and error-rate hotspots.

## Selected Projects

**High-Throughput Print Job Coordinator (Node.js, AWS Lambda, SQS, Rust)**  
A distributed workflow engine orchestrating print jobs across multiple regional vendors. Features idempotent processing, exponential backoff, structured observability, and localized fallback routing.

**Address Normalization & Validation Engine (TypeScript, MongoDB)**  
Designed a data-cleanliness subsystem that standardizes and validates millions of addresses daily while preserving partner-specific formatting constraints.

**React-Based Dispatch Console**  
An operational interface used by logistics teams to monitor real-time dispatch health, triage failures, and trigger reprints or route corrections.

---

## Technical Skillset

**Languages**  
TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, C/C++ (practical familiarity), SQL

**Frontend**  
React, TypeScript, component architecture, form systems, data-visualization primitives

**Backend**  
Node.js, Express/Fastify frameworks, REST API design, MongoDB, Redis, AWS Lambda, SQS, Batch, S3, CloudWatch, IAM

**Tooling & DX**  
OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman suites, automated API contract testing, Jest, Vitest

**Performance & Reliability**  
Profiling, CPU/memory optimization, queue-driven resiliency patterns, background jobs, rate-limiting and backpressure control

---

## Education

**B.Sc. — Computer Science**  
McGill University  
Systems architecture focus; high-scale distributed systems and API design.

---

## Additional Experience

- Technical writing for customer-facing API docs, SDKs, and internal runbooks.  
- Collaboration with logistics vendors and print partners; operational troubleshooting under tight SLAs.  
- Mentorship of junior engineers in Node.js, performance profiling, and frontend state architecture.

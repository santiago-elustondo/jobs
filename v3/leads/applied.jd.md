Amazing Career Moments Happen Here



Transforming the insurance industry is ambitious, we know. That’s why at Applied, we’re building a team that shows up every day ready to learn, willing to try new things, and driven to deliver innovative software and services that make us indispensable to our customers – all within a culture built on values that make us indispensable to each other too. With 40+ years of experience in the Insurtech game, we’re not just redefining what’s achievable; we’re creating a place where amazing career moments are made possible.



Position Overview



We’re searching for a Senior Software Engineer (React.js, Node.js) to join our Applied Payments team in a hybrid role. To keep us headed in the right direction, we’re looking for people who understand winning is a team sport, who value and seek to learn from our team’s diverse experiences and backgrounds, who welcome a challenge and take risks in the pursuit of creating better outcomes for our customers, and who can, at any given time, step back to laugh and have some fun.

As a senior engineer, you'll take ownership of key platform areas, help design the architecture, lead development efforts, and mentor junior engineers as the team grows. This is a rare opportunity to work with a nimble team within a well-established organization on a high-impact product and help shape its future direction.



What You’ll Do



Collaborate with cross-functional teams (engineering, product, QA) to build scalable, cloud-native software solutions
Collaborate as part of Agile Scrum teams in sprint planning, review, and retrospectives
Develop and maintain robust payment systems and applications.
Design and optimize systems for performance, reliability, and maintainability.
Build applications using GCP services.
Contribute to technical design discussions, mentor team members, and guide architectural decisions and best technical practices

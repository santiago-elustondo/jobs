Dear Hiring Team at Fitch Group,

I’m writing to apply for the Lead Software Engineer role in Toronto. Fitch’s emphasis on credibility, long-term impact, and technically rigorous delivery strongly resonates with how I’ve approached software engineering throughout my career.

I have over a decade of experience building and leading large-scale web platforms that sit at the intersection of business, data, and technology. In recent roles, I’ve operated as a senior technical leader responsible not just for shipping features, but for ensuring non-functional requirements—availability, performance, observability, and operational safety—are first-class concerns. I’m most effective in environments where systems are long-lived, stakeholder expectations are high, and technical decisions need to balance immediacy with durability.

At Lululemon, I led a horizontally embedded React/TypeScript platform powering loyalty features across multiple customer-facing applications, including marketing and account surfaces backed by Contentful. That work required close collaboration with security, IAM, and platform teams, rigorous isolation and observability practices, and constant alignment with product and marketing stakeholders. More recently at Rangle.io, I served as a Technical Director and senior individual contributor, mentoring engineers, reviewing architecture and PRs, and driving improvements in performance, delivery quality, and developer effectiveness across multiple web platforms.

What draws me to Fitch is the opportunity to apply that experience in a setting where engineering quality, transparency, and incremental delivery truly matter—particularly across marketing and data-driven web properties that must be reliable, scalable, and easy to evolve. I’m comfortable working across the stack, partnering closely with cloud and security teams, and helping junior engineers grow while still remaining deeply hands-on.

I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with Fitch Group’s Technology & Data organization and the challenges you’re solving. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Santiago Elustondo

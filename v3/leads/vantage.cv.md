## Blast Engine Inc. (TypeFirst Consulting)

**Founder / Technical Consultant**
*Jan 2024 – Present*

Hands-on frontend and full-stack consultant engaged to **stabilize, modernize, and extend existing platforms** for growth-stage and enterprise clients.

* Designed and implemented **data-driven React applications** where UI correctness, performance, and state modeling were critical to user trust.
* Worked closely with founders, product leads, and designers to translate loosely defined requirements into concrete UI architecture and component boundaries.
* Regularly audited existing frontend codebases for performance, test coverage, and architectural debt; delivered targeted refactors rather than wholesale rewrites.
* Provided mentoring and architectural guidance to in-house teams, focusing on React composition patterns, predictable state flow, and testability.

* Designed strict component isolation and typed public interfaces to ensure predictable integration across independently deployed micro-frontends.
* Built internal mechanisms for **error containment, observability, and analytics** at the component level, enabling safe rollout of data-driven features.
* Worked closely with product, design, and platform teams to align UX behavior across surfaces consuming the same underlying data models.
* Led architectural reviews and documentation to ensure long-term scalability of frontend patterns in a high-traffic retail environment.

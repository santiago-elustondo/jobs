## Professional Experience

### Senior Full-Stack Engineer — Operations & Field Reliability Platforms  
**OperantWorks (Toronto, ON)**  
2020–Present

Core contributor to a mobile-first workflow management product used by distributed teams in manufacturing, logistics, and facilities maintenance.

**Mobile-First Collaboration Features**

- Built cross-platform collaboration tools enabling technicians, managers, and operators to coordinate maintenance tasks, inspections, and safety workflows.  
- Delivered React Native features supporting offline-first operation, device synchronization, and low-connectivity conditions common in industrial environments.  
- Implemented responsive React dashboards for supervisors to review work orders, KPIs, and equipment health signals in real time.

**Full-Stack Systems Using TypeScript, Node.js, and GraphQL**

- Designed and implemented Node.js services powering task management, asset hierarchies, user permissions, messaging, and incident logging.  
- Authored GraphQL schemas, resolvers, and federation patterns for modular feature ownership across teams.  
- Optimized SQL query paths and introduced indexing improvements, reducing slow queries on high-volume tables by ~65%.

**Product-Centric Collaboration with PM & Design**

- Partnered closely with Product to plan multi-release initiatives, conduct customer interviews, and convert operational pain points into actionable design proposals.  
- Contributed technical insights to roadmap priorities, focusing on feasibility, sequencing, and long-term maintainability.

**System Ownership & Technical Leadership**

- Owned several core domains (collaboration, work-order lifecycle, notifications), driving their long-term evolution, documentation, and operational readiness.  
- Established internal patterns for maintainability: API boundary definitions, state-management conventions, input validation strategies, and error-handling frameworks.  
- Mentored intermediate engineers through architectural discussions, code review, and structured onboarding.

**Engineering Quality, Tooling, and On-Call**

- Introduced automated test harnesses using Jest + Playwright for integrated web/mobile flows.  
- Hardened CI/CD pipelines with per-feature test suites, efficient caching, and environment parity.  
- Participated in on-call rotation, resolving production incidents, analyzing root causes, and improving observability for future detection.

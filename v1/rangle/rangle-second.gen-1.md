### Rangle.io *(Nov 2022 – Dec 2023)*  
- *Technical Director – Developer Experience (DevEx) Lead* *(Jul 2023 – Dec 2023)*  
- *Technical Director* *(Nov 2022 – Jul 2023)*  

Senior technical leader responsible for **delivery quality, frontend and full-stack architecture, developer experience, and team growth** across multiple concurrent client engagements. Operated as a hybrid **hands-on technical authority and people leader**, with accountability for architectural decisions, delivery stability, and escalation management in high-pressure consulting environments.

**Leadership & Scope**
- Led and mentored ~**10 direct and indirect reports** spanning junior and senior developers, QA engineers, QA-to-developer transition cohorts, and solution architects.
- Acted as **primary escalation point** for complex frontend, full-stack, and performance issues across client projects.
- Balanced direct technical intervention with organizational leverage through standards, documentation, internal tooling, and knowledge dissemination.
- Supported hiring, onboarding, performance reviews, promotion advocacy, and growth planning with a strong emphasis on technical rigor and autonomy.

#### Momentive (SurveyMonkey) — Frontend Platform Performance & Stability  
**React | Next.js | TypeScript | Webpack | Bundle Analyzer | Statoscope | GraphQL**

Embedded technical lead within Momentive’s web platform organization to address **performance regressions and delivery risk** in a large, long-lived React/Next.js codebase.

- Led a **bundle-size investigation and remediation initiative** targeting excessive JavaScript payloads caused by transitive dependencies, barrel exports, and non-tree-shakable import patterns.
- Used **Webpack Bundle Analyzer** and **Statoscope** to trace dependency graphs from entrypoints through issuer paths, enabling safe, targeted removals.
- Achieved a **~50% reduction in parsed bundle size** (≈1.84 MB → ≈0.93 MB) with minimal code changes and no functional regressions.
- Established a **repeatable performance-debugging methodology** (hypothesis → measurement → remediation → verification) and transferred it to the team through live walkthroughs and documentation.
- Mentored team members through applying the techniques independently; coached and sponsored a developer to publish a long-form technical article detailing the approach.
- Provided stabilizing technical leadership during a **high-pressure period with team attrition and morale risk**, restoring delivery confidence and predictability.

#### Get Ahead — Embedded React Platform for Regulated AI Workflows  
**React | TypeScript | Micro-frontends | CI/CD | AI-assisted systems**

Senior technical lead for a time-constrained, greenfield engagement delivering an embedded frontend platform for regulated mental-health practitioners.

- Led a **4-developer agile team** delivering a **micro-frontend React SPA** compiled as a CI artifact and embedded within a host **Flutter** application.
- Designed the **integration contract** between host and embedded app, including runtime argument injection, serialized configuration, and isolation boundaries.
- Worked directly with client stakeholders to resolve **misaligned requirements, incomplete designs, and unclear AI service constraints**, translating ambiguity into a concrete, shippable architecture.
- Enabled in-session **AI-assisted workflows** (live transcripts, guided record generation) while maintaining regulatory, auditability, and data-handling constraints.
- Guided an anxious, early-stage team through delivery under tight timelines, resulting in a successful launch and **client re-engagement for a larger adjacent greenfield platform**.

#### JetBlue — Cross-Framework Design System & Platform Architecture  
**Web Components | Lit | React | Angular | Monorepos | CDN Delivery**

Senior technical authority supporting early-stage architecture for a multi-year design-system modernization initiative.

- Contributed to the architecture of a **framework-agnostic design system** supporting React, Angular, jQuery, and legacy backend-rendered applications.
- Led monorepo spikes evaluating **Lit, Stencil, and no-framework Web Component approaches**, converging on Lit based on maintainability and client constraints.
- Designed a dual delivery model where the core system shipped as:
  - a **private npm package** for framework consumers, and
  - a **CDN-hosted artifact** consumable directly via HTML tags.
- Established clear boundaries between **platform primitives and framework adapters**, reducing coupling and long-term maintenance risk.
- Represented Rangle publicly by presenting learnings on **Web Components as application-agnostic design-system infrastructure** at a professional community event.

#### Internal Platform Enablement & DevEx (Rangle.io)

Alongside client delivery, served as a **DevEx and platform leader** within Rangle.

- Built and maintained an internal **knowledge system** capturing architectural decisions, research outcomes, and delivery learnings.
- Led recurring internal talks and workshops on:
  - frontend performance engineering  
  - modern React and Next.js architecture  
  - build tooling and bundlers  
  - Web Components and cross-framework interoperability  
- Sponsored and reviewed internal R&D initiatives, open-source contributions, and technical articles, ensuring alignment with Rangle’s broader technical strategy.
- Championed a culture of **continuous improvement, technical ownership, and mentorship** across the organization.

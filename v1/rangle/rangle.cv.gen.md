### Rangle.io *(Nov 2022 – Dec 2023)*  
- *Technical Director – Developer Experience (DevEx) Lead* *(Jul 2023 – Dec 2023)*  
- *Technical Director* *(Nov 2022 – Jul 2023)*

Senior technical leader responsible for **frontend platform strategy, developer experience, and capability development** across multiple concurrent enterprise client engagements. Operated at the intersection of **architecture, performance engineering, internal enablement, and people leadership**, with a mandate to raise the technical ceiling of delivery teams while reducing execution risk for clients.

Led and mentored ~10 direct and indirect reports spanning junior/senior engineers, QA-to-developer transition cohorts, and solution architects. Acted as senior escalation point for complex frontend architecture decisions, delivery instability, and performance regressions. Balanced hands-on technical intervention with organizational leverage through documentation, standards, and internal knowledge systems.

#### Momentive (SurveyMonkey) — Frontend Platform Performance & Stability  
**React | Next.js | Webpack | Statoscope | Bundle Analyzer | GraphQL**

Technical lead embedded within Momentive’s Web Platform organization to address performance and delivery risks in a large, long-lived React/Next.js codebase.

* Led a **bundle-size investigation and remediation initiative**, identifying unintended transitive dependencies and inefficient import patterns across shared libraries.
* Reduced parsed JavaScript bundle size by **~50% (≈1.84 MB → ≈0.93 MB)** with minimal code changes and no functional regressions, using Webpack Bundle Analyzer and Statoscope to trace dependency graphs to root causes.
* Established a **repeatable performance-debugging methodology** (entrypoints → issuers → dependency chains) and transferred it to the team through live walkthroughs and documentation.
* Authored and sponsored a long-form technical article on bundle optimization; mentored a team member through applying the technique and publishing their own performance-focused write-up.
* Provided technical leadership in a **high-pressure delivery environment**, stabilizing team dynamics and restoring confidence during periods of attrition and delivery risk.

#### Get Ahead — Embedded React Platform for Regulated AI Workflows  
**React | TypeScript | Micro-frontends | CI/CD | AI-assisted workflows**

Senior technical lead for a greenfield, time-constrained engagement delivering an embedded frontend platform for regulated mental-health practitioners.

* Led a 4-developer team delivering a **micro-frontend React SPA** compiled as a CI artifact and embedded within a host Flutter application.
* Designed the integration contract between host and embedded app, including **runtime argument injection, serialized configuration, and isolation boundaries**.
* Worked directly with the client to reconcile **misaligned requirements, incomplete designs, and unclear AI service constraints**, translating ambiguity into a shippable architecture.
* Enabled in-session AI-assisted workflows (transcripts, guided record generation) while maintaining regulatory and auditability constraints.
* Guided an anxious, early-stage team through delivery, resulting in a successful launch and **client re-engagement for a larger adjacent greenfield platform**.

#### JetBlue — Cross-Framework Design System & Platform Architecture  
**Web Components | Lit | React | Angular | Monorepos | CDN Delivery**

Senior technical authority supporting early-stage architecture for a multi-year design-system modernization initiative.

* Contributed to the architecture of a **framework-agnostic design system** intended to support React, Angular, jQuery, and legacy backend-rendered applications.
* Led monorepo spikes evaluating **Lit, Stencil, and no-framework Web Component approaches**, converging on Lit based on maintainability and client constraints.
* Designed a delivery model where the core system shipped both as:
  * a private npm package (for React/Angular consumers), and
  * a CDN-hosted artifact consumable directly via HTML tags.
* Helped establish boundaries between **platform primitives and framework adapters**, reducing coupling between consumer applications.
* Represented Rangle publicly by presenting learnings on **Web Components as application-agnostic design-system infrastructure** at a professional community event.

#### Internal Platform Enablement & DevEx (Rangle.io)

In parallel with client work, served as a **platform and DevEx leader** within Rangle.

* Built and maintained an internal **knowledge system** capturing architectural decisions, research outcomes, and delivery learnings across projects.
* Led recurring internal presentations and workshops on:
  * frontend performance engineering
  * modern React and Next.js architecture
  * build tooling (Webpack, Rollup)
  * Web Components and cross-framework interoperability
  * emerging frameworks and platform tradeoffs
* Sponsored and reviewed internal R&D initiatives, open-source contributions, and technical articles, ensuring alignment with Rangle’s broader technical strategy.
* Actively supported hiring, onboarding, performance reviews, and promotion advocacy, with a strong emphasis on **growth trajectories and technical rigor**.

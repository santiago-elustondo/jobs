Sounds good. This sounds good. Yeah, always look at the other The Todd Perfectson So for each job description that I put there, which is, you know, example jobs that I'm that I want to apply to I've added a generated Todd Perfectson perfect resume that we can, you know, use as an inspiration as for what to write, but right now, let me give you some some info, so At conexis, I was hired to help a I believe it was called a VMS It was like a recruitment CRM type of thing A platform where a particular recruiting network Yeah Oh Conexis VMS I think it is I'm not sure I think VMS is some industry acronym, right? And this would be like It handles the It's kind of like a recruitment portal Where, you know, we take in where the client is able to walk through the different stages of management of the contract signing their office documents and communicate with the with the service provider which, you know, can action on these resumes and whatever, right? The agency the staffing firm provides a service to the to the client which is a recruiting service and this is like a a tool that they provide as an interface right? So I was brought in because they had an offshore team in Columbia that you know they felt wasn't moving at the speed that they needed or something and they hadn't met sometimes in the past they didn't speak English all that well except for like the manager perhaps and and they wanted somebody and they wanted to eventually actually build a team here and they wanted to start slowly moving out the knowledge and stuff like that right? Also they wanted to meet some deadlines of course an important client that was coming up so that was the contract So the technical tasks that I undertook most that they told me I need you to make me to solve the board challenges, technical problems, whatever that required communication with their client the client the client of the DMS was stuff like integrating with this big client in a manner that integrating with them and overseeing kind of architectural wise stuff it was clear to me entering this team that that the platform the platform itself, so this was a NestJS backend and a React frontend served with NestJS but not really utilizing very many of their features it was kind of an SPA using Postgres and there was an ORM involved which I can't quite recall they integrated with Nest and and their DevOps were very old school I mean it was cloud but they were SSHing boxes and stuff it was hard to untangle that but for example they needed to add single sign-on using SSL with like OAuth with you know XML, SSL, whatever with the client's Azure Active Directory so that they can log in with those accounts that needed to be coordinated that's one thing second thing that was important was RSS feeds the client was already posting jobs to a big company that already had a career stage or some RSS feed that went to various different channels and we needed to consume that RSS feed and populate our as if they had typed it into our system so this was you know like a Node.js and how did we do this well we wrote like a little engine like a standalone kind of micro service deployed on our own Azure that was again stay alive service that just monitored this RSS feed and fed it into our database we needed to watch for updates and all that so we needed to replicate we needed to adapt the data model to to to to reflect not reflect what's it called to mirror right okay another thing that was important was reporting so the they already had a very very simple report system I mean feature that basically was kind of a data dump from the post RSS tables so this was an in-depth data modeling exercise where I had you know prolonged conversations with them you know asking clarifying questions to understand the different you know these tables weren't designed like it wasn't like a tailor made set of tables it had grown over time there was some data that was just unstructured JSON and we needed to you know kind of make sense of what's there what the relations between different you know as you can imagine the data models can get very complex interdependent and that business domain model needed to be understood mapped out onto onto a reportable data set and build the backend features to the API endpoints to service the frontend application which was kind of a modern look um yeah um so another thing was to document where the technical debt was as I said as I started to say but didn't finish the team did turn out to not be fully in control it seemed clear to me that the application had been brought up by somebody else a more senior team earlier on of the same agency and then delegated to more junior developers to work on features so we had for example when we were working on the when I was working on the single sign-on authentication you know nobody on the team knew how how the authentication system worked at all we were signing our own keys we were storing them on the database it was quite simple it was pretty bare bones but nobody had looked at that also you know nobody had looked at the kind of framework level

Now, one thing I've noticed that you didn't quite understand me because the words sound alike. But you'll notice if you read the master conexis.mb file that some things kind of don't make sense. I noticed that you said that NestJS was being used, but that the framework features were not used entirely in the project. And also you said that the frontend was an SPA served with NestJS. This is not correct. So the NestJS, you tell me if this is an accurate description, but it's a backend framework. It's more for using decorators and your controllers and has an ORM attachment front. So, you need to read through it and make sure that this makes sense. So, what has happened is that I mentioned that NextJS with an X, right? So there's Nest and then there's also Next. The backend was Nest. The frontend was Next. These were two separate repos. And the NextJS one is the one that I said they weren't, the one that I meant to say they were not utilizing all the features as well as they could have to achieve best performance and behavior. This is also true for Auralinks. That's how I solved a lot of the, using Next with an X, NextJS features. I was able to move data to the server side, cache stuff. And because they weren't, you know, what I was saying is that it was kind of like an SPA. Like they were using NextJS, but ultimately most of the stuff was being client-side loaded and that's why you have this cascading effect. The same thing for conexis. Their frontend was not, the frontend architecture was really just throwing code together without a real plan, most of the actual framework-level thinking having been done for the backend, and by people who had by now been reallocated elsewhere by the agency. It wasn't really thought through and needed kind of senior analysis to give structure.

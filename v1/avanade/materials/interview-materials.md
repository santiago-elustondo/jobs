I am a **sr consultant at avanade**, a subsidiary of accenture, in toronto. I work with **enterprise clients** to build usually large scale solutions, they usually come to us with visions that are **well defined** and we help them in implementation. I am currently working with a **fintech** client from the states, and previously worked with a **telecom** company here in toronto. I specialize in full-stack JS (as i have for many years). this being from client apps (be it angular, react, react-native) to distributed node services and databases, to cloud deployment and maintenance, to devops. Sometimes the client will have some **architecture already in place**, and sometimes **pieces are missing or need an upgrade**, so all the sr consultants here are **prepared for asks** from the client in any of these areas, as long as its within their particular tech stack specialization, otherwise we are internally very well connected and behind the scenes we consult with our peers on a regular basis, it's part of our job description to provide expert support to other projects within avanade. I've also given a number of **multi-day training** bootcamps for avande developers in toronto and denver, on React and React-Native development.

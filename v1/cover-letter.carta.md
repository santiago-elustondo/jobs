Dear Carta Frontend Platform Team,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer II role on the Frontend Platform team. I have spent the last decade building, stabilizing, and evolving large-scale React and TypeScript systems where the primary challenge is not feature delivery, but sustaining velocity, correctness, and developer experience across many teams.

My career has consistently gravitated toward horizontal frontend platforms: monorepos, shared SDKs, build systems, and architectural standards that enable hundreds of engineers to ship safely. At lululemon, I led the frontend architecture for a loyalty platform that had to integrate horizontally across a federated micro-frontend ecosystem assembled via Webpack Module Federation. The work centered on dependency boundaries, failure isolation, and release safety—ensuring new functionality could be adopted incrementally without destabilizing checkout or other critical surfaces. Similar platform themes have carried through my work at Vaco and Rangle, where I was repeatedly asked to intervene at the system level: resolving performance ceilings, taming dependency sprawl, and making large React codebases predictable again.

I am particularly drawn to Carta’s Frontend Platform mission because it explicitly treats frontend infrastructure as a first-class product. Designing and maintaining a monorepo that supports many teams, driving React and dependency upgrades without widespread disruption, and investing in build tooling that engineers genuinely enjoy using are problems I have worked on repeatedly. I have led bundle-size and build-time reduction efforts, designed shared client SDKs consumed across multiple surfaces, and introduced platform-level observability and error isolation so teams can move quickly without fear.

In recent work through my consulting practice, TypeFirst, I have continued to focus on frontend platform architecture: monorepo governance, TypeScript as a contract-enforcement tool, and developer experience systems that scale with organizational growth rather than fighting it. Across roles, my approach is consistent: make constraints explicit, push complexity to shared infrastructure, and ensure that individual feature teams can be productive without needing deep platform expertise.

Carta’s goal of building an end-to-end ERP for private markets resonates strongly with me. Systems of record demand frontend platforms that are correct by construction, operationally boring, and resilient to constant change. I would be excited to contribute my experience in frontend platform engineering to help Carta continue to raise the bar for engineering velocity and developer experience.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with the Frontend Platform team’s goals.

Sincerely,
Santiago Elustondo

## Blast Engine Inc. (Consulting)

**Founder / Technical Consultant**
*Jan 2024 – Present*

Senior consultant supporting **enterprise modernization and stabilization initiatives**, operating as hands-on technical lead across backend services, identity, data modeling, and frontend integration.

* Led re-platforming efforts for **multi-tenant enterprise systems**, translating legacy assumptions into explicit architectural constraints enforced at API and data boundaries.
* Designed and implemented **Node.js service layers** integrating with Azure-hosted infrastructure (Redis, PostgreSQL, identity providers), formalizing contracts and error semantics.
* Delivered **SSO integrations (Azure AD–style OAuth/SAML)**, working directly with enterprise IT and security stakeholders to document token flows, refresh semantics, and failure handling.
* Built ingestion and integration services consuming external feeds, enforcing idempotency, validation, and domain normalization.
* Produced architecture documentation and onboarding materials to reduce key-person dependency and support internal team scaling.

## Rangle.io

**Technical Director, DevEx Lead**
*Nov 2022 – Dec 2023*

Senior technical leader responsible for **engineering quality, architectural standards, and developer experience** across multiple enterprise client engagements.

* Led and mentored ~10 engineers (senior, intermediate, and transitioning QA), setting technical direction and growth plans.
* Served as escalation point for complex frontend and full-stack issues involving performance, build systems, and architectural drift.
* Led modernization initiatives focused on **bundle optimization, dependency hygiene, and runtime performance**, establishing repeatable diagnostic and remediation workflows.
* Guided teams building **React-based platforms** integrated into larger enterprise ecosystems, emphasizing isolation boundaries, API contracts, and observability.
* Partnered with product, UX, and client stakeholders to convert unclear or conflicting requirements into implementable technical plans.

## Lululemon

**Engineering Lead — Loyalty Platform**
*Nov 2021 – Nov 2022*

Technical lead for a **horizontal platform modernization initiative** delivering loyalty capabilities across a large, federated frontend ecosystem.

* Led design and delivery of a **shared loyalty platform** consumed by checkout, product, search, and account experiences owned by independent teams.
* Defined architectural patterns for **safe cross-team integration**: strictly typed component contracts, error boundaries, feature flagging, analytics, and centralized observability.
* Coordinated design reviews and approvals with security- and compliance-sensitive teams, balancing governance with delivery timelines.
* Championed modularization of legacy flows into **reusable, API-backed UI capabilities**, reducing duplication and integration risk.
* Mentored engineers in scalable React patterns, defensive programming, and production-readiness.

## Vaco Toronto

**Director, Technical Solution Delivery / Technical Lead**
*Jun 2020 – Nov 2021*

Delivery authority combining **hands-on architecture** with **technical governance and escalation ownership** across enterprise consulting engagements.

* Led discovery, requirements decomposition, KPI definition, and roadmap planning for complex modernization programs.
* Architected **distributed, multi-region systems** enforcing data residency and compliance constraints through routing and service boundaries rather than UI logic.
* Designed **API-driven client/server architectures** with explicit contracts, shared TypeScript SDKs, and centralized integration logic.
* Led design of **event-driven and pub/sub-based messaging systems**, formalizing delivery semantics, encryption boundaries, and traceability.
* Established release governance, CI discipline, and infrastructure-as-code workflows supporting predictable multi-team delivery.
* Acted as final escalation point for production issues, conducting root-cause analysis across application, data, and infrastructure layers.

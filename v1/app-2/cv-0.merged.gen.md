## Professional Experience

---

## Blast Engine Inc. (Consulting)

**Co-Founder / Technical Consultant**
*Jan 2024 – Oct 2025*

Senior technical consultant engaged to **stabilize, harden, and unblock enterprise systems** under delivery or operational pressure. Focused on restoring architectural clarity, reducing key-person dependency, and enabling internal teams to own systems long-term.

**Representative Work**

* Acted as senior technical authority for growth-stage SaaS platforms, performing deep audits across backend services, frontend architecture, identity flows, and data models.
* Designed and implemented enterprise integrations including **SSO (OAuth/SAML with Azure AD)**, background ingestion services, and event-driven interoperability.
* Led remediation of fragile multi-tenant assumptions, implicit data coupling, and undocumented operational behavior.
* Delivered durable APIs, service boundaries, and documentation sufficient to support hiring, onboarding, and independent operation.

## Rangle.io

**Technical Director, DevEx Lead**
*Nov 2022 – Dec 2023*

Senior technical leader responsible for **delivery quality, developer experience, and engineering growth** across multiple concurrent client engagements.

* Led and mentored ~10 engineers across seniority levels, including QA-to-developer transition cohorts.
* Acted as escalation point for complex frontend, full-stack, and performance issues.
* Balanced direct technical intervention with leverage through standards, documentation, internal tooling, and knowledge sharing.
* Led production performance remediation for large React/Next.js systems, including bundle-size reduction through dependency audits, import-path correction, and bundler configuration—achieving significant payload reductions with minimal code churn.
* Served as senior technical lead on embedded frontend platforms (React micro-frontends hosted inside native shells), defining integration contracts, isolation boundaries, and delivery workflows under tight timelines.
* Supported architecture and modernization initiatives (design systems, cross-framework component strategies), advising on long-term maintainability and platform boundaries.
* Authored and delivered internal talks, demos, and articles translating consulting lessons into repeatable engineering practices.

## Lululemon

**Engineering Lead — Loyalty Platform**
*Nov 2021 – Nov 2022*

Technical lead for a **horizontal loyalty initiative** spanning a large, federated React/Node ecosystem composed of independently owned micro-frontends assembled via Webpack Module Federation.

* Architected a dedicated loyalty platform repository delivering **self-contained, versioned UI modules** embedded across checkout, PDP, search, and account experiences.
* Designed exported components to be **safe by default**: strict typing, serializable props, error boundaries, and internal observability (analytics, error reporting) owned centrally.
* Coordinated architectural approvals with security- and compliance-sensitive teams, particularly checkout.
* Built development workflows mirroring production host environments to surface bundle, dependency, and runtime risks before integration.
* Mentored engineers in distributed frontend architecture, defensive integration patterns, and production-grade React practices.

## Vaco Toronto

**Director, Technical Solution Delivery / Technical Lead**
*Jun 2020 – Nov 2021*

Delivery authority combining **hands-on architecture** with **governance and escalation ownership** for complex consulting engagements.

* Led discovery, KPI definition, roadmap construction, team formation, and production stabilization.
* Converted ambiguous requirements into explicit system invariants (data boundaries, routing rules, latency/error budgets, release mechanics).

**Enterprise Realtime & Distributed Systems**

* Designed geo-aware architectures supporting **multi-region deployments under data residency and sovereignty constraints**, enforcing compliance structurally rather than by convention.
* Architected a **platform-agnostic TypeScript client SDK** centralizing region resolution, endpoint selection, and multi-socket orchestration for web and React Native clients.
* Designed a **cross-region realtime messaging abstraction** preserving socket-style APIs while introducing encrypted pub/sub transport for inter-region delivery.
* Led root-cause analysis and remediation of persistence bottlenecks (MongoDB write amplification, indexing, retention behavior).
* Established release governance, QA strategy, and infrastructure-as-code workflows enabling predictable multi-repo delivery.

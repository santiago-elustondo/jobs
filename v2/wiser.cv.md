## Profile

Senior software engineer with 12+ years of experience working across **large frontend applications, backend services, and data-heavy systems** in enterprise and high-growth environments. Repeatedly engaged to **diagnose performance problems, stabilize production systems, and design safer architectural boundaries** across teams.

Background spans **Node.js/TypeScript services, .NET/Java backends, SQL-heavy data access layers, large React/Angular frontends**, and distributed messaging systems. Comfortable operating in ambiguous environments where requirements are incomplete, systems are already under load, and correctness and operability matter more than greenfield purity.

## Core Technical Experience

**Backend & APIs**

* Node.js (TypeScript), Express-style services
* .NET / Java services with GraphQL and REST
* Authenticated, customer-facing APIs (JWT-based flows)
* Service-to-service communication, async workflows

**Data & Performance**

* SQL Server (query design, indexing, execution plan analysis)
* MongoDB, Redis
* GraphQL resolver performance, N+1 mitigation, query shaping
* Data access layer refactoring under load

**Frontend**

* React (large applications, micro-frontends, federation)
* Angular (AngularJS → Angular, Angular 10+)
* Runtime performance optimization, change-detection control
* Accessibility-conscious UI work in regulated contexts

**Distributed Systems & Infrastructure**

* Real-time messaging (socket.io-style semantics)
* Pub/Sub patterns, Redis-backed fanout
* Docker, Kubernetes / OpenShift
* Terraform-managed infrastructure
* CI/CD, release governance, observability

## Blast Engine Inc. (Consulting)

**Founder / Technical Consultant**
*Jan 2024 – Present*

Independent consulting focused on **technical risk reduction** for growth-stage and enterprise clients.

* Conducted deep-dive technical reviews of existing systems to identify **scaling bottlenecks, performance ceilings, and architectural coupling**.
* Documented undocumented systems to remove key-person dependency and enable safer onboarding of new engineers.
* Designed incremental remediation plans prioritizing **measurable improvements** over speculative rewrites.
* Hands-on work across backend services, data access layers, and frontend integration boundaries depending on client need.

(Engagements included vendor management systems, healthcare platforms, and B2B SaaS products with compliance and data-integrity constraints.)

## Rangle.io

**Technical Director / DevEx Lead**
*Nov 2022 – Dec 2023*

Senior technical leader responsible for **engineering quality, performance, and delivery confidence** across multiple client teams.

* Led and mentored teams of junior, intermediate, and senior engineers; acted as escalation point for technically blocked projects.
* Personally led **performance investigations** on large React applications, including bundle size reduction through dependency audits and import-path restructuring.
* Guided teams through ambiguous requirements and delivery pressure, providing architectural clarity and hands-on problem solving when systems degraded.
* Oversaw internal R&D, knowledge-sharing initiatives, and technical demos.

**Selected Work**

* **Momentive (SurveyMonkey)**: Led bundle analysis and reduction work using webpack tooling and dependency restructuring; improvements were measurable and adopted team-wide.
* **Get Ahead**: Technical lead on an embedded React application integrated into a Flutter host, coordinating frontend/backend contracts under unclear AI-service constraints.

## Lululemon

**Engineering Lead — Loyalty Platform**
*Nov 2021 – Nov 2022*

Technical lead for a **horizontal loyalty initiative** spanning a highly distributed React ecosystem assembled via **Webpack Module Federation**.

* Designed and owned a **loyalty component library** embedded across checkout, PDP, search, and account surfaces owned by independent teams.
* Enforced strict isolation boundaries: typed, serializable props; internalized side effects; mandatory error boundaries.
* Built internal infrastructure for centralized **Sentry instrumentation, analytics tagging, and feature flagging**, allowing safe rollout without host-team ownership.
* Integrated deeply with Lululemon’s customized **Contentful-based CMS**, enabling dynamic content updates without redeploying host applications.
* Established development workflows using linked host repositories to surface **bundle size, dependency conflicts, and runtime behavior** before production.
* Worked directly with checkout and platform teams on security, auth, and compliance approval paths.

## Vaco Toronto

**Director, Technical Solution Delivery / Technical Lead**
*Jun 2020 – Nov 2021*

Senior delivery and technical lead across enterprise client engagements, operating at the intersection of **backend systems, real-time infrastructure, and global deployments**.

* Led backend architecture for **globally distributed collaboration systems**, balancing latency, data residency, and reliability.
* Designed messaging abstractions preserving real-time semantics while supporting **cross-region delivery** using Redis and Pub/Sub-style systems.
* Investigated and resolved production issues involving **MongoDB write pressure, indexing strategies, and retention behavior**.
* Defined release processes, environment provisioning, and observability standards to support multi-region operations.
* Regularly performed root-cause analysis on failures caused by downstream services and integration boundaries.

## Avanade (Accenture)

**Senior Software Consultant / Technical Lead**
*Oct 2018 – Jun 2020*

Technical lead on enterprise telecom and financial services platforms with **heavy emphasis on data correctness and performance**.

* Worked on large **.NET / Java-based backend systems** with SQL Server at the core.
* Designed, optimized, and refactored complex SQL queries; analyzed execution plans; reduced query latency under production load.
* Led performance remediation of **GraphQL APIs**, addressing resolver inefficiencies, N+1 patterns, and client-side query misuse.
* Contributed to a large Angular application, delivering features and implementing **high-impact UI performance improvements**.
* Built Node.js microservices for telecom platforms, diagnosing failures caused by unreliable downstream dependencies.
* Worked with OpenShift, AWS, and Terraform to improve observability and deployment reliability.

## Rangle.io

**Software Developer**
*Apr 2017 – Oct 2018*

Full-stack engineer on enterprise client work and open-source tooling.

* Core contributor to **Augury**, the Angular DevTools extension, including performance inspection and visualization features.
* Conducted performance audits on AngularJS and hybrid mobile applications (Cordova/WebRTC).
* Supported large-scale AngularJS → Angular migrations under tight timelines.

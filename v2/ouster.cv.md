## Profile

Hands-on front-end engineering leader with 12+ years building and scaling **complex, data-heavy browser applications** in enterprise and growth environments. Proven track record leading teams while remaining deeply involved in **architecture, performance optimization, and code quality**.

Specializes in React-based systems operating under real constraints: large runtime surfaces, distributed ownership, live data, strict reliability requirements, and long-lived codebases. Frequently trusted to stabilize systems, define safer integration boundaries, and mentor teams delivering high-performance UI at scale.

## Core Technical Focus

**Frontend Architecture**

* React (large applications, federated MFEs, shared libraries)
* TypeScript / JavaScript (ES6+)
* Runtime performance optimization, isolation patterns
* Accessibility and reliability in customer-facing apps

**Tooling & Delivery**

* Webpack, Module Federation, bundle analysis
* CI/CD, release governance, automated testing
* Playwright / Jest-style test frameworks
* Observability and error instrumentation (Sentry)

**Data-Driven UI**

* Complex state orchestration
* Analytics-heavy and configuration-driven UIs
* Live and near-real-time data surfaces
* Strong API contract discipline with backend teams

**Leadership**

* Front-end team leadership and mentorship
* Code reviews and architectural governance
* Cross-functional collaboration with Product, Design, Platform
* Translating ambiguous requirements into executable plans

## Professional Experience

---

## Blast Engine Inc. (Consulting)

**Founder / Technical Consultant**
*Jan 2024 – Present*

Independent consulting focused on **front-end architecture, performance, and delivery risk** in mature systems.

* Engaged by teams facing scaling or operability issues in complex UI platforms.
* Performed deep audits of React applications to identify performance ceilings, architectural coupling, and unsafe ownership boundaries.
* Designed incremental remediation strategies prioritizing **measurable improvement** over rewrites.
* Worked hands-on across component architecture, data flow, and runtime behavior.

---

## Rangle.io

**Technical Director / DevEx Lead**
*Nov 2022 – Dec 2023*

Senior technical leader responsible for **front-end quality, performance, and developer effectiveness** across multiple teams and clients.

* Led and mentored senior, intermediate, and junior front-end engineers while remaining deeply hands-on.
* Acted as escalation point for complex UI performance and architectural issues.
* Oversaw delivery across multiple parallel projects with distinct UI requirements and data shapes.

Representative Work:

* **Momentive (SurveyMonkey)**: Personally led bundle size and runtime performance investigations using webpack tooling and dependency audits. Delivered measurable improvements with minimal functional change; coached team members to independently apply techniques.
* **Embedded & Visualization-Heavy UIs**: Led teams building non-trivial React applications with dense data presentation and custom interaction models, requiring careful control over rendering cost and state propagation.

## Lululemon

**Engineering Lead — Loyalty Platform**
*Nov 2021 – Nov 2022*

Technical lead for a **horizontal front-end platform** embedded across a highly distributed React ecosystem assembled via **Webpack Module Federation**.

* Led development of a **shared component library** consumed by multiple independently owned micro-frontends (checkout, PDP, search, account).
* Designed strict **isolation and safety guarantees** for exported components:
  * Typed, serializable props only
  * Mandatory error boundaries
  * Encapsulated side effects and services
* Built internal infrastructure for:
  * Centralized error instrumentation and analytics
  * Feature flagging and controlled rollout
  * CMS-driven dynamic content
* Established workflows mirroring production behavior by linking host applications locally to detect bundle impact, dependency conflicts, and runtime integration issues early.
* Worked closely with UI/UX partners to translate complex designs into reliable, scalable implementations.

This role closely mirrors the Ouster requirement of **hands-on technical leadership** in a front-end system with **many use cases, heavy data flow, and high performance expectations**.

## Vaco Toronto

**Director, Technical Solution Delivery / Technical Lead**
*Jun 2020 – Nov 2021*

Senior technical lead on enterprise platforms requiring **real-time UI behavior, global distribution, and high reliability**.

* Led front-end and platform architecture discussions across multiple teams.
* Designed real-time UI integration patterns backed by socket-based messaging abstractions.
* Investigated production issues where UI performance and reliability degraded under scale.
* Balanced delivery timelines with architectural correctness and observability.

---

## Avanade (Accenture)

**Senior Software Consultant / Technical Lead**
*Oct 2018 – Jun 2020*

Worked on large enterprise applications with **heavy data interaction and complex UI surfaces**.

* Contributed to large Angular applications with performance and responsiveness constraints.
* Led investigations into UI jank, change-detection overhead, and rendering inefficiencies.
* Partnered with backend teams to reshape API usage and query patterns to better support frontend performance.
* Delivered internal training on performance profiling and optimization.

---

## Earlier Experience

**Rangle.io — Software Developer**
*Apr 2017 – Oct 2018*

* Core contributor to **Augury**, the Angular DevTools extension.
* Built performance inspection and visualization tooling for large Angular applications.
* Worked closely with the Angular community and framework internals.

# TypeFirst — Technical Consulting, Platform Architecture & Systems Engineering

**Founder / Principal Engineer / Senior Technical Consultant**
**2024 – Present**
Toronto, ON (Remote)

TypeFirst is an independent technical consulting and engineering practice providing senior-level architecture, systems design, and platform stabilization for growth-stage and enterprise-adjacent organizations. Engagements span platform products, managed services, and hybrid consulting models, with a consistent focus on **system legibility, data integrity, performance under scale, and organizational sustainability**.

I operate as a **fractional Staff / Principal-level engineer**, embedded where teams lack senior technical bandwidth, inheriting ambiguous systems and converting them into explicit, governable platforms suitable for growth, hiring, and scrutiny.

---

## Scope of Responsibility (Across Engagements)

* Acted as senior technical authority across **architecture, delivery, hiring, and operational readiness**.
* Inherited systems built under time pressure and external agencies; replaced tribal knowledge with explicit artifacts.
* Owned cross-cutting concerns including:

  * Platform architecture
  * Data modeling and consistency
  * Identity and enterprise integrations
  * Frontend performance and data-loading discipline
  * DevOps safety and observability baselines
* Served as technical translator between:

  * Business leadership
  * Enterprise clients and partners
  * Internal and offshore engineering teams

---

## Platform & Systems Architecture

* Designed and remediated full-stack TypeScript systems using:

  * **Node.js / NestJS** backends
  * **Next.js / React** frontends
  * **GraphQL and REST** APIs
* Recovered and rationalized **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** schemas that had evolved organically:

  * Clarified domain boundaries
  * Identified implicit relationships
  * Enabled defensible reporting and analytics
* Implemented and hardened **multi-tenancy** models appropriate to:

  * Platform products (tenant isolation, data scoping)
  * Managed services (service isolation, client-specific behavior)

---

## Enterprise Integration & Identity

* Designed and implemented **enterprise SSO** integrations using **Azure Active Directory**, OAuth, and SAML.
* Built and operated integration services consuming:

  * Webhooks
  * RSS feeds
  * Polling-based change detection
* Coordinated directly with enterprise IT and security teams to validate:

  * Authentication semantics
  * Token handling
  * Data contracts
* Implemented event-driven coordination using **Redis / PubSub** and background services.

---

## Data Modeling, Reconciliation & Consistency

* Designed **canonical internal domain models** spanning multiple external systems (e.g. HubSpot, Shopify, NetSuite).
* Implemented reconciliation pipelines to:

  * Detect discrepancies between competing systems of record
  * Track freshness and confidence of data representations
  * Support operator-controlled synchronization
* Treated integrations as **stateful, inspectable systems**, not fire-and-forget automations.

---

## Frontend Architecture & Performance Engineering

* Diagnosed and remediated frontend systems misusing modern frameworks as SPAs:

  * Excessive client-side fetching
  * Cascading request dependencies
  * Duplicated data access
* Re-architected data loading using **Next.js SSR and server-side data aggregation** where appropriate.
* Introduced shared data services and central stores to:

  * Reduce request fan-out
  * Improve perceived latency
  * Enforce architectural discipline
* Improved performance without wholesale rewrites, preserving delivery velocity.

---

## DevOps, Deployment Safety & Observability

* Established pragmatic DevOps baselines on **Azure** and **Google Cloud**:

  * GitHub Actions CI/CD
  * Branch-based non-production environments
  * Safer release workflows without removing manual production control
* Introduced observability fundamentals:

  * Structured logging
  * Correlation and tracing discipline
  * Runbook-grade documentation
* Reduced operational anxiety and key-person dependency during incidents.

---

## Team Leadership, Hiring & Enablement

* Embedded as de-facto technical lead for junior and offshore teams.
* Provided:

  * Architectural guidance
  * Pull request review
  * Direct intervention on complex issues
* Led hiring for direct individual contributors (including international contractors), reducing reliance on agencies.
* Leveraged bilingual communication (English / Spanish) to improve delivery clarity and collaboration.

---

## Documentation, Audits & Organizational Legibility

* Produced documentation suitable for:

  * New engineer onboarding
  * Investor and external technical review
  * Leadership decision-making
* Delivered:

  * System maps
  * Architectural narratives
  * Technical debt registers
  * Forward-looking remediation plans
* Enabled leadership to reason about technical risk with evidence rather than intuition.

---

## Thought Leadership & Technical R&D (TypeFirst Brand)

* Conducted independent research and writing on:

  * Advanced TypeScript and type-driven architecture
  * Compiler-enforced constraints
  * Modern frontend data-flow patterns
  * AI-assisted development under architectural guardrails
* Published articles, videos, and talks aimed at senior engineers and technical leads.
* Designed patterns using the TypeScript compiler as:

  * An architectural enforcement mechanism
  * A constraint surface for AI-assisted code generation
* Fed these ideas back into consulting work via framework-level abstractions and tooling.
